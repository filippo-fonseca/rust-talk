# üéâ Rust Talk

A terminal-based chat app built in Rust.

NOTE: This is my first project in Rust, so take it with a grain of salt. It's very basic :).

## Setup

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and its respective package manager, Cargo, installed on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repo & change directories**

```
git clone git@github.com:filippo-fonseca/rust-talk.git

cd rust-talk
```

**2. Run and/or Build**

To run the app, open two separate terminal windows.

On one of them, `cd` into the `server`, while on the other go into the `client`, as such:

**Window 1:**

```
cd server
```

**Window 2:**

```
cd client
```

Now, in both terminal windows run the following command (make sure you run it in the terminal window assigned to the `client` first):

```
cargo run
```

To create a usable version, run:

```
cargo build
```

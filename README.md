# 🎉 Rust Talk

A terminal-based chat app built in Rust.

Warning: This is my first project in Rust, so take it with a grain of salt. It's very basic :).

## Setup

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and its respective package manager, Cargo, installed on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repo**

```
git clone git@github.com:filippo-fonseca/rust-talk.git

cd rust-talk
```

**2. Run**

To run the app, use:

```
cargo run
```

To create a usable version, run:

```
cargo build
```
